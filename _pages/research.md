**[Friend-based Ranking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05093.pdf)**
  - with [Francis Bloch](https://www.sites.google.com/site/francisbloch1/home)

  - We analyze the design of a mechanism to extract a ranking of individuals according to a unidimensional characteristic, such as ability or need. Individuals, connected on a social network, only have local information about the ranking. We show that a planner can construct an ex post incentive compatible and efficient mechanism if and only if every pair of friends has a friend in common. We characterize the windmill network as the sparsest social network for which the planner can always construct a complete ranking.
