**[Friend-based Ranking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05093.pdf)**
  - with [Francis Bloch](https://www.sites.google.com/site/francisbloch1/home)

  - We analyze the design of a mechanism to extract ordinal information disseminated in a social network. We show that friend-based ranking—the report by individuals on the characteristics of their neighbors—is a necessary condition for ex post incentive-compatible and efficient mechanism design. We characterize the windmill network as the sparsest social network for which the planner can construct a complete ranking. When complete rankings cannot be achieved, ex post incentive-compatible and efficient mechanisms arise when social networks are bipartite or composed of triangles. We illustrate these findings using real social networks in India and Indonesia.
