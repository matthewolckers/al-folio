**Financial literacy in South Africa**
  - with [Lwanga Elizabeth Nanziri](https://sites.google.com/view/elnanziri), University of Stellenbosch.


  - We analyse measures of financial literacy,  included  in  the  NIDS  survey for the first time in Wave 5. South  Africa  follows  patterns  found  in  other  countries. Less educated and low  income  respondents  display low levels of financial literacy. Most countries have large gender gaps in financial literacy while the  gender  gap  is  absent in  South  Africa.  Controlling  for  a  number  of  socio-demographic  variables,  financial literacy is positively related to ownership of a pension and of mutual funds, stocks, or shares.
