**Gamblers Learn from Experience**
  - with [Joshua Blumenstock](http://www.jblumenstock.com/), UC Berkeley.

  - Sports betting---a type of gambling with an element of skill---has grown wildly popular in East Africa. Commentators worry that low ability gamblers will not learn from experience. Using data on mobile money and gambling transactions for over 50 000 Kenyan smartphone users, we find that gamblers do learn from experience. Gamblers are less likely to bet following poor results and more likely to bet following good results. The reaction to positive and negative feedback is of equal magnitude, which fits a model of Bayesian updating.

**On Track for Retirement?**

  - Over sixty percent of employees at a large South African company contribute only the minimum rate of 7.5 percent of their salary to a retirement fund---far below the rate of 15 percent recommended by financial advisers. I use a field experiment to investigate whether providing employees with a retirement calculator, which shows projections of retirement income, leads to increases in contributions. The impact is negligible. The lack of response to the calculator suggests many employees may wish to save less than the 7.5 percent minimum. I provide a model of asymmetric information to explain the current equilibrium.

**Financial Literacy in South Africa**
  - with [Lwanga Elizabeth Nanziri](https://sites.google.com/view/elnanziri), University of Stellenbosch.

  - We analyse measures of financial literacy,  included  in  the  NIDS  survey for the first time in Wave 5. South  Africa  follows  patterns  found  in  other  countries. Less educated and low  income  respondents  display low levels of financial literacy. Most countries have large gender gaps in financial literacy while the  gender  gap  is  absent in  South  Africa.  Controlling  for  a  number  of  socio-demographic  variables,  financial literacy is positively related to ownership of a pension and of mutual funds, stocks, or shares.
