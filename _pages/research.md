**Friend-based Ranking**
  - with [Francis Bloch](https://www.sites.google.com/site/francisbloch1/home), Paris School of Economics.

  - We analyze the design of a mechanism to extract a ranking of individuals according to a unidimensional characteristic, such as ability or need. Individuals, connected on a social network, only have local information about the ranking. We show that a planner can construct an ex post incentive compatible and efficient mechanism if and only if every pair of friends has a friend in common. We characterize the windmill network as the sparsest social network for which the planner can always construct a complete ranking.

**Biased updating creates a gambling trap: Evidence from sports betting in Kenya**
  - with [Joshua Blumenstock](http://www.jblumenstock.com/), UC Berkeley.

  - We develop a model to show how biased updating can lead to persistent overconfidence in one's ability, and highlight the negative welfare implications of this overconfidence. We validate key assumptions and predictions of this model using a unique dataset that captures rich details on the gambling decisions of over 50,000 Kenyans. The data show that gamblers react asymmetrically to (exogenous variation in) wins and losses. The bias in the learning process causes gamblers to increase betting expenditures over time. Exogenous increases in betting expenditures cause gamblers to take out high-interest loans, thus creating scope for persistent debt traps.

**Financial literacy in South Africa**
  - with [Lwanga Elizabeth Nanziri](https://sites.google.com/view/elnanziri), University of Stellenbosch.


  - We analyse measures of financial literacy,  included  in  the  NIDS  survey for the first time in Wave 5. South  Africa  follows  patterns  found  in  other  countries. Less educated and low  income  respondents  display low levels of financial literacy. Most countries have large gender gaps in financial literacy while the  gender  gap  is  absent in  South  Africa.  Controlling  for  a  number  of  socio-demographic  variables,  financial literacy is positively related to ownership of a pension and of mutual funds, stocks, or shares.
