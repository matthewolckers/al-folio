I work as a research fellow in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/computer-science-and-engineering) at [UNSW Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). I am part of team, led by [Toby Walsh](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tw/), studying how to build fair, transparent and explainable AI.  

Although I now work in an engineering department, my training is in economics. I completed my PhD in Economics at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/).

My research interests include social networks, development economics and household finance. I am particularly interested in the intersection of economics and computer science, such as using mechanism design in practical applications or using alternative data sources to answer questions about poverty and development.

I lead the Asia-Pacific working group on [Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG)](http://md4sg.com/) and I am an affiliate of [SoDa Labs](https://www.monash.edu/business/soda-labs/home).

Outside of my research, I love surfing, helping out at church, travelling with my wife, and seeing graffiti on trains. I compiled a [book about graffiti](https://books.google.co.za/books/about/Painting_Cape_Town.html?id=rd_hCgAAQBAJ) in Cape Town, South Africa, which subsequently evolved into a [documentary](https://www.paintingcapetown.co.za/documentary/).
