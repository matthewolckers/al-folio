I recently completed my PhD at the Paris School of Economics, under the supervision of [Francis Bloch](https://www.sites.google.com/site/francisbloch1/) and [Margherita Comola](http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/comola-margherita/). I am now working as a research fellow at Monash University with [Arthur Campbell](https://sites.google.com/site/arthurcampbellecon/) and [Yves Zenou](https://sites.google.com/site/yvesbzenou/).

My research interests include social networks, development economics and household finance. I am particularly interested in the intersection of economics and computer science, such as using mechanism design in practical applications or using alternative data sources to answer questions about poverty and development.

Outside of my research, I love surfing, helping out at church, travelling with my wife, and seeing graffiti on trains. I compiled a [book about graffiti](https://books.google.co.za/books/about/Painting_Cape_Town.html?id=rd_hCgAAQBAJ) in Cape Town, South Africa, which subsequently evolved into a [documentary](https://www.paintingcapetown.co.za/documentary/).
