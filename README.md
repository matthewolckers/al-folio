# Personal Website
My website, built using the al-folio Jekyll theme.

## Notes to self

### Steps to update
1. Run Git BASH (or command prompt on laptop) in the local folder
2. Edit locally using  `bundle exec jekyll serve`
3. Commit and push all changes to this repo.
4. Run `./bin/deploy`
5. Add custom domain name again (this is probably something I could fix)
